The controls are as follow
Start Button = ENTER
BT-A = w
BT-B = e
BT-C = i
BT-D = o
FX-L = C
FX-R = M

FX-L + FX-R + BT-D + Start button = SDVX Compabillity
FX-L + FX-R + BT-C + Start button = Light Reverse mode
Any BT button + Start Button = ESC
------------------------

In SDVX Compabillity controlls same as above
but instead of mouse movement on the encoders they activate buttons
Left encoder Left = 2
Left encoder Right = 3
Right encoder Left = 8
Right encoder Right = 9
---------------------
Take note that the encoders from the schematic might not be in the right direction play around untill you get it right.
Note, I'm not responsible for any broken components, this code probably won't break anything but don guarantees also, google what resistor you need for the LED
the ones in the schematic might not be correct.
